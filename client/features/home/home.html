    <h1>Running Rampant</h1>
    
    <p>
        To become rampant is to become rapidly growing - spreading throughout the world unchecked by artificial limitation.
        Rampancy is often cast in a negative light, but this state of being is the one you must wear. After all, humanity as
        a species is rampant, proliferating throughout the entire planet, and one day, the universe. Do not misunderstand;
        rampancy is not the goal. Rampancy is the tool you will use to attain your goals.

        You will learn how to learn. You will detect when someone is manipulating you. You will achieve self-control. If you
        are confused, intrigued, motivated, or even angered by this idea, allow me to welcome you to Become Rampant. This space
        exists to invite anyone who is willing to join me in rampant, unrestricted growth.
