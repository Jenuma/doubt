        <h1>It looks like you're using Internet Explorer.</h1>
        
        <p>Some features of Become Rampant may not work correctly if you continue.</p>
        
        <h2>Why not?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Internet Explorer needs special, old code to be compatible with modern web technology - the same technology
            we utilize to bring you a great experience. The reason we don't go the extra mile to be compatible with
            Internet Explorer is because we <strong>don't want you to be at risk</strong>. Many versions of this browser
            have security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to steal information, money, or even your identity with.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What can I do to be safer online?</h2>
        
        <p>
            We recommend you download a different web browser, such as:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Google Chrome</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            All of these options are free to download and use indefinitely and are safer and easier to use
            than Internet Explorer. When you return to becomerampant.com, you will no longer see this message.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What is a web browser?</h2>
    
        <p>
            A web browser is the program (or application, or "app") that you use to go to websites. If you bought
            a PC with Windows, it came preloaded with Internet Explorer. However, it is highly recommended to download
            a different browser from the list above to stay safe andexperience all the modern technology the Internet has to
            offer. For more information, click <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">here</a>.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What if I can't install a new browser on this computer?</h2>
    
        <p>
            We understand that there may be a situation in which you can't download a new web browser - for example, if you
            are using a work or library computer that prevents users from installing new programs. You can still proceed to
            Become Rampant if that is the case, but beware that many features may not work, and the site may be unsightly
            to view.
